Test for setting up api calls between two sites

Two project:
MVC is the page used to call the api
Click in the Call User Api 2 to call remote site

API is the page that houses the API. 
Also contains a standard mvc site with About page under authentication.
Logout and other stuff is part of the default template so will not really work
